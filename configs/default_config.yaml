##### MODEL
# This code will be used to build sub-directories for input, output data etc.
model_run_code: ''

##### FRAMEWORK OPTIONS
framework:
    # These options only work when using run-nomopyomo_edm-i.sh or queue-nomopyomo.sh
    # If both are True, both types of .lp files are built but the model is only solve with the like_pyomo file
    tinyomo: True # If True builds the nomopyomo .lp (hard for humans to read). If like_pyomo is False solves the problem with the nomopyomo file and generates a nomopyomo .mps file.
    like_pyomo: False # If True builds the .lp and .mps files like pyomo (human readable, for debugging) and solves the problem with these files.
    keep_MPS: True # if True the model .mps file is downloaded from the server and saved in your local output folder (otherwise it can be found in the raw_output folder on the server)
    keep_LP: False # if True the model .lp file is downloaded from the server and saved in your local output folder (otherwise it can be found in the raw_output folder on the server)
    keep_files: True # if True the intermediary files (objective.txt, constraints.txt, bounds.txt) are downloaded from the server and saved in your local output folder (otherwise they can be found in the raw_output folder on the server)

##### SOLVER OPTIONS
solver:
    # glpk: solve the model locally on your laptop
    # gurobi: send the model to the remote solver (need to be connected to the WI intranet)
    name: gurobi # gurobi or glpk
    shadow_prices: True # default: True (retrieve shadow prices)
    threads: 0 # default 0 (all available cores are used)
    method: -1 # default -1 (concurrent solvers - primal simplex, dual simplex and barrier); set 1 for dual simplex; setting algorithm might reduce run times of model); set 2 for barrier
    LogToConsole: 0
    OutputFlag: 1
    optTol: 1e-6 # default 1e-6
    feasTol: 1e-6 # default 1e-6
    dual_reductions: 1 # default 1
    crossover: -1 # default: -1 (automatic); 0 means Crossover is disabled (Note: disabling Crossover does not work with concurrent optimizers e.g. method = -1)
    presolve: -1 # default: -1 (automatic); 0 means Presolve is disabled; 1 and 2 correspond to conservative (1) and aggressive (2) presolving
    aggregate: 1 # default: 1 (moderate); 0 means Aggregate is disabled; 1 and 2 correspond to moderate (1) and aggressive (2) aggregation level in presolve
    solution_target: -1 # default: -1 (automatic); 0 means primal and dual optimal and basic; 1 means primal and dual optimal
    scale_flag: -1 # default: -1 (scaling on); set to 0 to turn off scaling, to 2 for geometric mean scaling (well suited for matrix with wide range in coefficients), to 1 or 3 to experiment with other scaling methods
    pre_dual: -1 # default: -1; set to 0 to forbid presolve from forming the dual (might reduce run times of model)
    bar_homogeneous: -1 # default: -1; set to 1 to force homogeneous barrier algorithm
    seed: 0 # default: 0; set to a positive integer to set the seed for the model run (it creates a small random perturbation in the model)
    bar_dense_thresh: 0 # default: 0. Set to 100 if you have problems with dense columns.

#### INPUT OPTIONS
processes:
    retrofit: True # If True, allow for capacity retrofit at end of life
transport:
    hub: True # If True, all locations are indirectly connectd to one another via a transport hub

#### OUTPUT OPTIONS
output:
    units: default_var_units.csv # csv file with units for each variable. Must be located in the configs/ folder.
    post_process: True # If True, runs some cleaning up and compressing of outputs
