# ITOM - Industry Transformation Optimisation Model

**Welcome to ITOM - the Industry Transformation Optimisation Model framework.**[^1]

With this framework you have all the building blocks you need to generate full-fledged systems optimisation models that you can apply to explore future pathways for the basic industries.

ITOM is meant for geographically detailed techno-economic bottom-up linear optimisation model. It optimises investments in production assets and plant operations, generating cost-optimal pathways towards future production networks in the industrial sectors that you have defined. It can account for single plants or production sites and the infrastructure between them. The minimum total cost solution is constrained by boundary conditions defined by the modeller such as emission limits, waste and scrap availability, and quality requirements for final products.

[^1]: Before being open sourced in this repository, ITOM was developped and applied in a number of projects under the name WISEE EDM-I (Wuppertal Institute System model architecture for Energy and Emission scenarios Energy Demand Model - Invest).

# Installation
 - Download the code from this repository or `git clone` it.
 - Install the requirements in a [python virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).
 - Run `python3 src/run.py -s SCENARIO_NAME` from the repo's folder after you have prepared input data in the required format.

# Applications
This repo is limited to the ITOM framework itself, without data to model industrial sectors.
However, extensive model applications of the European [petrochemical](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15773103), [steel](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15772719), and [cement](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15773257) sectors 
(including documentation, input and output data) are available on Zenodo.

# Documentation
A preliminary documentation of the modelling framework is available on [readthedocs](https://itom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
