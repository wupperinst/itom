CapacityToActivityUnit,"REGION, TECHNOLOGY",1,"unit of output (activity) / unit of capacity per year, e.g. PJ/GW-YR, Mt/Mt-YR","For processes whose capacity and activity units are the same, use a factor of 1. If not using yearly time steps, use the length of a time step (e.g. 10 year steps: CapacityToActivityUnit = 10). For power plants we use a factor of 31.536, which is the level of energy production in PJ produced from 1 GW operating for 1 year (1GW * 8760 * 3600 / 10^6)."
AvailabilityFactor,"REGION, TECHNOLOGY, YEAR",1,fraction of hours in year,Maximum time technology may run for the whole year. Often used to simulate planned outages. The model will choose when to run or not to run.
OperationalLife,"REGION, TECHNOLOGY",1,years,Operational lifespan of a process in years.
LocalResidualCapacity,"REGION, TECHNOLOGY, YEAR",0,GJ or Mt,The capacity left over from periods prior to the modeling period.
InputActivityRatio,"REGION, TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCT, YEAR",0,Ratio,The input (use) of product per unit of activity for each technology (i.e. inverse efficiency).
OutputActivityRatio,"REGION, TECHNOLOGY, FUEL, YEAR",0,Ratio,Ratio of output to activity. Should be 1 for a technology/process and its primary output product. Can be different than 1 for a technology/process and its secondary output products.
