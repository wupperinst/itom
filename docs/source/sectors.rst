Sectoral models
*********************

The `ITOM GitHub repo`_ is limited to the modelling framework itself, without the implementation of sectoral models.
Potential users are encouraged to use the framework to implement their own sectoral models, taylored to their research questions.
However, to get a better feeling of what the ITOM framework can do, the following provides pointers to open data sectoral models that have been implemented with ITOM.
